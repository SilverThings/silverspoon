        This example shows how to use Servlet REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Rest DSL

        From a web browser you can access the REST service to retrieve temperature form the configured sensors:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="rest/temperature">temperature</a> - to view the temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
        This example offers an API browser using Swagger which is accessible from the following link
        <ul>
            <li><a href="api-docs">api-docs</a> - list all CamelContexts in the JVM that may have REST services</li>
            <li><a href="api-docs/temperature">api-docs/temperature</a> - temperature - overview of the apis from the REST services</li>
        </ul>

        <p/>
        To use the swagger ui, follow this link. Replace the URL value with this one to access the REST local resources <strong>http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}/api-docs</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">swagger</a> - swagger ui page</li>
        </ul>
